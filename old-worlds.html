      <h1>Old World Tarantulas</h1>

      <h2>Location</h2>

      <p>Old world tarantulas are named as such due to originiating from countries in the pre-Columbus "Old World";
        European, Asian and African tarantulas fall under the Old World category.</p>
      <h2>Not for Beginners</h2>
      <p>Old World tarantulas are only recommended for expert keepers. Their infamous temperaments combined with their
        lightning fast speed and potent venom bring a whole new challenge to tarantula husbandry. This isn't to say that
        new hobbyists can't get them, but prior research and confidence around spiders is imperative.</p>
      <h2>Temperament and Risk</h2>
      <p>Old World tarantulas often have demon-like temperaments. Furthermore, spiders in this collective pack a venom
        that's far more potent than their New World counterparts. As if this isn't enough, Old World tarantulas move
        quicker than the human eye can see, meaning they seem to "teleport" from one place to another. Their
        lightning-fast movements often takes people by surprise, resulting in accidents and injury to the keeper or the
        spider.</p>
      <h2>The Defences of the Old World Tarantula</h2>
      <p>Unlike New World species', Old World spiders lack urticating hairs. This leaves them with two options; flight
        or bite. Many Old Worlds are all too aware of their "medically significant" venom and will likely prefer to hold
        their ground and opt for choice number two. This is often bad news for the owner.</p>

      <h2>Handling</h2>

      <p>Handling is often discouraged in the tarantula community. Tarantulas are very delicate creatures and a fall
        from as low as three or four inches can easily result in a ruptured abdomen. Regardless of knowledge or handling
        experience, tarantulas are highly unpredictable and sudden movements can cause panic.</p>
      <p>When handling Old World species, the risks are far greater for both arachnid and keeper. Old World venom causes
        intense pain and can lead to hospitalisation.</p>

      <h2>Summary</h2>

      <p>Old World tarantualas are lightning-fast, typically highly aggressive and pack a painfully potent venom. Due to
        these three factors, they are only recommended for expert keepers. If you're looking at getting a pet tarantula,
        I would highly advise you to research a New World species. </p>

    <div class=faveName>
      <h2>Pterinochilus murinus</h2>
    </div>

    <div class=faveTxt>
      <p>Common Names: OBT/Orange Baboon Tarantula/Orange Bitey thing. Perhaps the most notorious tarantula in the
        hobby. These bright orange balls of chaos and anger are definitely a force to be reckoned with. The P.murinus is
        famously aggresssive and <b>will</b> use that potent venom if it gets the chance. The infamy surrounding these
        crazy cats is what draws me to them. Well, that and their vibrant colouration.</p>

    <div class=faveTxt>
      <p>Common Name: Gooty Sapphire Ornamental. The P.metallica is a much-coveted specimen. The striking tones of blues
        and yellow adorning these spiders make them great for photos. Don't get too close though, these bad boys are
        <b>fast.</b>

    <div class=faveTxt>
      <p>Common name: "Horned Baboon". I picked this for my list due to the strange addition of a horn. No one is
        completely sure what purpose this serves.</p>
