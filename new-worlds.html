            <h1>New World Tarantulas</h1>
            <p>When Mr Columbus discovered the Americas (Northern, Southern and Central), he coined these newfoundlands
                as 'The New World'. Consequently, any tarantula indigeonous to these parts of the world are catagorised
                as New World species.</p>

            <h2>Ideal for Beginners</h2>
            <p>Due to their usually docile nature, tarantulas from the New World collective are often recommended to
                beginners as first spiders. New World tarantulas are far less likely to attack; making them easier to
                clean, feed and maintain.</p>
            <h2>The Venom of a New World Species</h2>
            <p>Unlike Old World tarantulas, New Worlds have a very mild venom. A lot of people that have reported being
                bitten by a New World tarantula describe the swelling and pain inflicted on a similar level to a bee
                sting. There's very little known about allergies and tarantula venom however, so it's always best to
                exercise caution.</p>
            <h2>Temperament</h2>
            <p>New World tarantulas typically lack the angry charateristics of their Old World cousins.Although highly
                advised against, if you wanted a tarantula to handle, for instance, then a New World species would
                really be your only option. The same can be said if you have children that will be playing an active
                part in any husbandry. New World's are your friends.</p>
            <h2>Defence</h2>
            <p>New World spiders would much prefer to flee than attack if provoked or threatened. Furthermore, rather
                than biting, their first go-to if unable to flee are urticating hairs. These these are barbed in design
                and lodge themselves into your skin. The tarantula uses these by kicking their rear legs rapidly,
                shooting a barrage of the hairs towards you. Being on the receiving end of this is no fun as it causes
                severe irritation, itchyness and a rash.</p>

            <h2>Acanthoscurria geniculata</h2>
        </div>

        <div class=faveTxt>
            <p>Commonly known as the "Brazilian Whiteknee", the A.gen is a a fiesty fellow. With voricious appitites,
                these spiders can reach up to 8.5 inches across a diagonal leg-span. These are proud spiders and love to
                be out and about, rarely hiding. With vivid cream stripes on a chocolate brown body make these a
                stunning display piece and a must for every collection.

            <p>Commonly known as the Antilles Pink Toe, the C.versicolor is a firm favourite amongst many keepers.
                Starting life with a vivid blue colour, they grow into a flourish of greens and purples. The C.versi is
                an arboreal species, so require a taller enclosure.

        </div>

        <div class=faveTxt>
            <p>Common name: "Curly Hair". The B.albopilosum is not much more than a big fuzzy ball of friendliness and
                that's why they have earned a space in my top 4.
